Included all necessary PCB files. If you dont intend to
modify the PCB, use the zip file, available on OSHPark (https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/3Ss2o3g2), 3.85 USD for a set of three. Share with friends the way I did!

Add the con-3.5mm-stereo-smt.lbr to eagle before proceeding to modify
the schematics and board.
BOM
2x 3.5mm stereo jacks
2x BC547 Through Hole NPN Transistor
2x 1.5k resistor
2x 3.5mm stereo cables

For Canon cameras, purchase a 3.5mm to 2.5mm stereo conversion jack. The conversion jack goes into the camera, and the 3.5mm cable connects into the conversion jack on one side and the PCB on the other (3.5mm jack on the board closest to the transistors)


Connect the phone with a 3.5mm stereo cable to the connector on the opposite side of the transistors. Download the triggertrap app and start using this amazing app+dongle to get some exceptional high speed shots of balloons blasting or cups smasing.
